## Project Description

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe using React. It allows two players to take turns marking squares on a 3x3 grid to win the game. Here's how it works:

## Gameplay

1. **Player Names**: At the beginning of the game, you can set the names of Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O) by clicking the "Edit" button next to each player's name.

2. **Game Board**: The game board consists of a 3x3 grid. Players take turns clicking on an empty square to place their symbol (X or O). Once a square is chosen, it cannot be selected again.

3. **Winning**: The game continues until one player has three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until all squares are filled, resulting in a draw.

4. **Game Over**: When the game ends with a winner or a draw, a "Game Over" message is displayed, along with an option to start a new game.
